## 🚀 What Problem Are We Solving?

After talking to **1000+ students, professionals, and startup founders**, we discovered key problems in self-learning:

- 📌 **Too many resources, no clarity** — Over 2000+ resources online, but no direction on what suits **you**.
- 🧭 **Lack of clear roadmaps** — Students have goals, but don’t know **how to reach them**.
- 🛠️ **Hard to find right-fit resources** — Even professionals and founders struggle.
- 💤 **Procrastination & short attention spans** — Over 50% give up mid-way.

Openln solves this by **giving you a personalized roadmap**, broken into **daily tasks and challenges** that help you level up with consistency — no more confusion, no more wasted time.
